Hux was the mole within the First Order that Finn and Poe had received information from. When asked, he tells them that he wasn't doing it to help the Resistance, but rather because he didn't want Kylo Ren to win. Ren arrives and faces off Rey, in which he reveals that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; her father was the son of the Emperor. He also reveals that they are a dyad in the Force, two that are one in the Force. Then, Kylo once again offers for Rey to join him, but she refuses, escaping in the Falcon. After they leave, Pryde kills Hux for treason against the First Order and assumes control of the First Order military. Palpatine contacts Pryde and demands that he use one of the specially equipped Star Destroyers to destroy Kijimi as an act of loyalty and Pryde complies. Pryde tells Kylo that even though they don't have the dagger, they know where the Resistance is going because they scanned it while it was still in their possession."

As Skywalker emerged from the base, Ren ordered all of the walkers to open fire on Skywalker in a futile attempt to destroy him. However, the Jedi Master miraculously emerged unscathed, and Ren felt the need to go down to the surface and face his old master himself, despite Hux's advice to the contrary. In a brief confrontation, Skywalker dodged Ren's lightsaber attacks. When Skywalker allowed Ren to land a blow, and the blade passed through his body without harming him, Ren realized that he was actually fighting a Force projection of the Jedi, who was still on Ahch-To. Skywalker's projection vanished. Unable to feel Skywalker's life force, Ren was assured he had successfully defeated and avenged his predecessors. The resistence was able to escape, but the First Order will continue to track these traitors."

Unable to escape the First Order Navy, the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa, fled to a former Rebel outpost on the salt-covered planet Crait, hoping to go unnoticed. However, the First Order became aware of the Resistance's plan and deployed their military forces to the planet's surface. <br>Led by the newly self-appointed Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and General Armitage Hux, the First Order deployed a superlaser siege cannon, planning to break through the massive door which protected the outpost. The Resistance, limited in numbers, had planned to hold out in the base until more allies arrived, but in response to the First Order cannon, the remaining Resistance troops utilized V-4X-D ski speeders to attack the weapon. The Resistance airspeeders faced many losses against the TIE/fo space superiority fighters of the First Order, but when the light freighter Millennium Falcon arrived to help the Resistance, Ren redirected the TIE fighters to pursue the starship. Although the Resistance ski speeders were no longer targeted by the TIE fighters, their efforts were unsuccessful, and the siege cannon fired upon the outpost."

The event took place during the cold war and marked the annihilation of Courtsilius, Raysho, Hosnian, Cardota, and Hosnian Prime, the capital of the New Republic. Its destruction was carried out by Starkiller Base, a superweapon capable of destroying entire star systems. With the destruction of Hosnian Prime came the destruction of the Galactic Senate and the home fleet of the New Republic Defense Fleet. The massive sub-hyperspace ripple created by the destruction of the system caused the event to be visible in real time around the galaxy, including the planets of Takodana and Vardos. After the destruction of the Hosnian System, the conflict between the First Order and the Resistance escalated into full open warfare."
